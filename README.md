# For-jicks

Hey Jicks.

Before you clone the repo, I want to explain a few things.

The website is 80% done. The only things remaining are the mobile versions and the header.

I want your help with the header.

I can really explain how the header should be so I included a refrence for you to use.

The main file is Image.Html [ THIS IS WHERE ALL THE WORK IS]

The "Refrence to css.html" file in the repo is for you to use and help me DO the header.
It is also responsive so you can use that to set the responsiveness in the Image.html file

I'VE DONE THE ANIMATION PART AND ALL THAT.

sO JUST HELP ME WITH THE HEADER AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SITE SO THAT IT WILL FIT IN ON MOBILE.
